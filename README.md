# DeepScope
Microscopic Images of Water Samples at 1000x Magnification

The Reference_Images folder contains 17 microscopic images of water undreath an AmScope M150 Micrscope with some images using methylene blue dye. The rainwater puddle images were classified unsafe as per a color change coliform test. The coliform color change test did not find any coliform bacteria in the shower and clean water samples. But, I observed a substanial amount of particulates in the shower water, so I classified it as unsafe. 

The Testing_Images folder contains 160 microscopic images of water undreath an AmScope M150 Micrscope with some using methylene blue dye. Sources 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are water bodies found in the Sammamish, WA area. Sources 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 are clean, drinking water purchased at my local grocery store. Color change coliform did not indicate any coliform bacteria in samples from sources 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8. Samples from sources 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 were classified unsafe as per a color change coliform test.
